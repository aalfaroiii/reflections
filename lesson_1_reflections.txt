Alfonsoâ€™s Version Control lesson 1 Reflections 

1) How did viewing a diff versions of a file help you spot the bug?

It was helpful because I could see the two file text side by side witout having to switch windows. I the larger file it was nice to use the diff -u in the teminal line bacuase the computer did most of the comparing for me in the 1000+ line file and only brought up the modules that had differences on the for me to analize them and correct them.
